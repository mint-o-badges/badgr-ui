		"mainDesc": "Open Educational Badges is based on preliminary considerations for an open badge system that can be used in school and extracurricular contexts as well as an initial technical feasibility study for an “Open Badges platform” that is being carried out at the Institute for Geoinformatics at the University of Münster within the framework of the BMBF project senseBox Pro was carried out. As part of the hackathon “#WirFürSchule” 2020, the project idea was further developed with an interdisciplinary team and a first prototype was implemented. The version of Open Educational Badges presented here is based on the open source Open Badges standard “badgr“ from concentricsky and was implemented with the kind support of the Deutsche Telekom Foundation by re:edu GmbH & Co. KG in collaboration with Junge Tüftler*innen gGmbH. A development of integrations to platforms of the senseBox Pro project (Blockly learning environment and openSenseMap) is being developed within the framework of BMBF funding.",

The aim is to open up additional innovation paths and potential. At the same time, innovation cycles should be significantly shortened and the networking of these groups should be sustainably improved.",

	"FAQ": {
		"Q1": "1. What are Open Educational Badges?",
		"A1.1": "Open Educational Badges (OEB) are a tool to standardize the visibility of learning experiences and competence acquisition. Open Educational Badges rely on three elements:",
		"A1.2": "1. A platform to create, award, and collect badges in a standardized manner.",
		"A1.3": "2. The standardized competence framework ESCO, which makes competence certificates from different institutions comparable and interoperable.",
		"A1.4": "3. An active community that uses badges.",
		"A1.5": "Due to the technical and content standardization, Open Educational Badges can be used everywhere - no matter where learning takes place.",
		"A1.6": "Badges themselves are digital certificates that standardize and verify that learners have made certain learning experiences and acquired corresponding competences. They are based on an Open Badges standard, originally developed by the Mozilla Foundation. Technically speaking, Open Badges are digital images like pictograms or logos that contain individual metadata - additional information that describes, for example, who receives this badge, which organization has awarded it, and which competences have been acquired.",
		"Q2": "2. What are Open Educational Badges useful for?",
		"A2.1": "Open Educational Badges make learning experiences and competence acquisition visible - no matter where learning takes place.",
		"A2.2": "Learners get a detailed overview of their individual competence profile. They know what they can do, where their strengths lie, and how they want to develop further.",
		"A2.3": "Awarders have the opportunity to make their learning offerings visible with Open Educational Badges. In addition, Open Educational Badges support them in documenting the impact of their work.",
		"A2.4": "Appreciators receive not only the formal grades of the applicants, but also an individual competence profile. They have the opportunity to assess the applicants better.",
		"Q3": "3. How do I pass Open Educational Badges?",
		"A3": "o issue a badge, registration and the creation of an institution are necessary. Subsequently, the awarding institution creates a badge and assigns it to the learners via their respective email addresses.",
		"Q4": "4. How is it insured that an issuing person belongs to the specified institution?",
		"A4": "Currently, access as an awarding person is only granted by invitation. This ensures the trustworthiness of the awarding person.",
		"Q5": "5. How are badges distributed? Which data do I have to or can I as instituion take from the learners?",
		"A5": "Data protection is of the highest priority. Therefore, Open Educational Badges operate with maximum data economy. To award a badge, the awarding institution requires the names of the participants as well as their respective email addresses. Participants receive their badge via the email addresses. The email addresses serve as identifiers to assign the badges to the learning individuals.",
		"Q6": "6. Where are the badges? What data must/may I as an organization collect from learners?",
		"A6": "Technically, the badges are currently hosted on the Hetzner server of OpenSenseLab. With the expansion of the project, there are plans to find a suitable location that ensures free access for learners at all times, as well as guarantees the secure and permanent storage of the badges."
