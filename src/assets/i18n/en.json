		"Q1": "1. What are Open Educational Badges?",
		"A1.1": "Open Educational Badges (OEB) are a tool to make learning experiences and the acquisition of skills visible in a standardized way. Open Educational Badges rely on three elements for this:",
		"A1.2": "1. A platform to create, award, and collect badges in a standardized way.",
		"A1.3": "2. The standardized ESCO skills framework, which makes credentials from different institutions comparable and compatible.",
		"A1.4": "3. An active community that uses badges.",
		"A1.5": "Thanks to technical and content standardization, Open Educational Badges can be used everywhere – no matter where learning takes place.",
		"A1.6": "Badges themselves are digital certificates that verifiably prove in a standardized way that learners have had certain learning experiences and acquired corresponding skills. They are based on an Open Badges standard originally developed by the Mozilla Foundation. From a purely technical point of view, Open Badges are digital images such as pictograms or logos that contain individual metadata – i.e., additional information that describes, for example, who receives this badge, which organization awarded it, and which skills were acquired.",
		"Q2": "2. What are Open Educational Badges useful for?",
		"A2.1": "Open Educational Badges make learning experiences and the acquisition of skills visible – no matter where learning takes place.",
		"A2.2": "Learners get a detailed overview of their individual skill profile. They know what they can do, where their strengths lie, and how they want to develop further.",
		"A2.3": "Awarding institutions can use Open Educational Badges to make their learning opportunities visible. In addition, Open Educational Badges support them in documenting the impact of their work.",
		"A2.4": "Recognizing institutions receive not only the formal grades of applicants, but also an individual skill profile. They have the opportunity to better assess applicants.",
		"Q3": "3. How do I award Open Educational Badges?",
		"A3": "To award a badge, registration and the creation of an institution are necessary. Subsequently, the awarding institution creates a badge and awards it to the learners via their respective email addresses.",
		"Q4": "4. How is it ensured that an awarding person belongs to the specified institution?",
		"A4": "Currently, access as an awarding person is only granted upon invitation. This ensures the trustworthiness of the awarding person.",
		"Q5": "5. How does the awarding of badges take place? Which services must or may I, as an institution, collect from the learners?",
		"A5": "Data protection has the highest priority. Therefore, Open Educational Badges works with maximum data economy. To award a badge, the awarding institution needs the names of the participants and their corresponding email addresses. The participants receive their badge via the email addresses. The email addresses serve as identifiers to assign the badges to the learning individuals.",
		"Q6": "6. Where are the badges located?",
		"A6": "Technically, the badges are currently located on the Hetzner server of OpenSenseLab. As the project expands, there are plans to find a suitable location that ensures free access for learners at all times and guarantees the secure and permanent storage of the badges."
