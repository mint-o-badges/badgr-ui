		"mainDesc": "Open Educational Badges is based on preliminary considerations for an open badge system that can be used in school and extracurricular contexts as well as an initial technical feasibility study for an “Open Badges platform” that is being carried out at the Institute for Geoinformatics at the University of Münster within the framework of the BMBF project senseBox Pro was carried out. As part of the hackathon “#WirFürSchule” 2020, the project idea was further developed with an interdisciplinary team and a first prototype was implemented. The version of Open Educational Badges presented here is based on the open source Open Badges standard “badgr“ from concentricsky and was implemented with the kind support of the Deutsche Telekom Foundation by re:edu GmbH & Co. KG in collaboration with Junge Tüftler*innen gGmbH. A development of integrations to platforms of the senseBox Pro project (Blockly learning environment and openSenseMap) is being developed within the framework of BMBF funding.",
