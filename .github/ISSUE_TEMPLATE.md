The Badgr Project (https://badgr.org) consists of badgr-server and badgr-ui, open source software released by Concentric Sky. Feature Requests and Issues that touch both badgr-server and badgr-ui should be filed on [badgr-server](https://github.com/concentricsky/badgr-server-prerelease/issues). If there is a bug that is known to be a UI-specific issue that will not touch the badgr-server codebase, it may be filed here.
